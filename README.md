# Pixiv2Telegram

This programme can fetch favorite images from Pixiv and forward them to Telegram thanks
to [pixivpy3](https://github.com/upbit/pixivpy) and [pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram).

I've had enough of downloading images from Pixiv **ONE BY ONE**, so I made this programme in order to
download them automatically in a certain interval on a Linux server.

As for me, I would like to save every interesting images in Telegram where I can browse my honey
conveniently and that's why I forward images to Telegram. Nevertheless, If you are willing to save them in another
place, you just need to modify it slightly.
